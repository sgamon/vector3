[Vector 3](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4353/vector-3)

Greg Costikyan published the game Vector 3 with SPI in 1979, and retains the 
copyright. He released the game under a CC 3.0 license in 2009.

Costikyan's website is off-the-air, making it difficult to obtain Vector 3. I 
dug it out of the Internet Archive. I am parking it here to give it a longer-
living home.
